Normal points will be part of a cluster so it will take more number of splits to isolate them. In this method, Isolation Forest recursively splits the data by randomly selecting a feature and then a random split value of the feature until the data-points are isolated in their own leaf nodes. Then an average depth is calculated across a large number of trees (forest). The average depth is then converted to an anomaly score between the scale of -1 and 1. A score of -1 indicates defintely an anomaly and a score of 1 indicates a normal
